Players / Turns / Numbers / Question / Answer / Lives

# Create a 2-Player math game where players take turns
# to answer simple math addition problems.
# A new math question is generated for each turn
# by picking two numbers between 1 and 20.
# The player whose turn it is is prompted the question
# and must answer correctly or lose a life.


# Both players start with 3 lives.
# They lose a life if they mis-answer a question.
# If a player gets a question wrong,
# the game should output the new scores for both players,
# so players know where they stand.

# The game doesn’t end until one of the players loses all their lives.
# At this point, the game should announce who won
# and what the other player’s score is.
